Rules:
===
These are the rules taken directly from Google:
- The final rankings will be determined using a computerized tournament designed by the contest organizer. The official results will be final. The ongoing rankings on the leaderboard are not official and may not be representative of the final results.
- You can only have one account. If you have effective control over more than one account, even if the accounts are all nominally owned by other people, you will be disqualified.
- Your program may not take more than one second to make any individual move. If you want to do intensive calculations, be sure to add some code that checks the time at regular intervals so you don't go over your one second quota. If your program violates its time quota, it will be automatically suspended.
- Entries which are deemed to violate the spirit of fair and sportsmanlike competition will be disqualified without any opportunity for appeal. In particular, memory scanning, intentionally losing games, and behavior conditional on the opponent's identity are prohibited.
- You may not write to files. You may however read from files within your submission directory, which will be the current directory.
- Use of multiple processes or threads is prohibited.
- Any attempt to disrupt the normal operation of the contest software or the contest servers will result in the immediate involvement of law enforcement officials. Our policy is to always prosecute.
- We reserve the right to change these rules at any time without notice.
